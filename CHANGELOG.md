# Changelog

All notable changes to clawhub.md are documented here.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **`installAll` command format standardized**: all scenario bundles now use `clawhub install ...` (matching individual skill format) instead of `/install ...` — eliminates the two-format confusion on guide pages

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`meeting-prep` scenario**: "Run Better Meetings" — prep with calendar/email context, summarize docs before the call, save notes to Notion
- **`installAll` on all scenarios**: `stay-connected` and `research-and-notes` now have one-command install

### Changed
- **`code-review` scenario expanded to full dev lifecycle**: renamed "Review, QA & Ship", added `gstack/ship` as 3rd skill, updated `installAll` to include all three
- **`ship-and-deploy` scenario replaced** by `meeting-prep` — the dev lifecycle is now consolidated under `code-review`

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`installAll` field on ScenarioBundle**: single `/install` command to install all skills in a scenario bundle at once — shown as "Install everything at once" on `/guide/[slug]` pages
- **`configSnippet` field on ScenarioBundle**: optional CLAUDE.md snippet rendered at bottom of guide pages
- **Adaptive subtitle**: guide pages show "Or install N skills individually" when `installAll` is present, vs "Install N skills to get started" when absent
- **Tests**: 2 new tests covering `installAll` command format validation and optional field types on `ScenarioBundle`

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Onboarding Layer Pivot**: restructured homepage as a newcomer guide ("The OpenClaw Starter Guide") with a Day 1 section and scenario-based navigation
- **Scenario bundles**: new `ScenarioBundle` type with `goal` + `skillsWithReason` fields — accessible at `/guide/[slug]`
- **`/guide/[slug]` pages**: step-by-step scenario guides with numbered skills, reasons, and install boxes
- **Scenario grid on homepage**: "What are you trying to do?" cards linking to `/guide/code-review` and `/guide/ship-and-deploy`
- **Two curated scenarios**: Code Review & Quality, Ship & Deploy
- **Day 1 block**: hardcoded "install these skills first" section with `gstack/review`, `gstack/ship`, `gstack/qa`
- **CSS classes**: `.scenario-grid`, `.scenario-item`, `.guide-skill-list`, `.guide-skill-item`, `.day1-block`, `.empty-state` — all responsive with mobile breakpoint at 640px

### Changed
- `bundles.ts`: refactored to discriminated union `RegularBundle | ScenarioBundle`; `getBundle()` now excludes scenarios; new exports `getScenario()`, `getScenarios()`, `getRegularBundles()`
- `/bundles` and `/bundles/[slug]` now filtered to regular (non-scenario) bundles only
- Homepage section order: hero → Day 1 → scenario paths → OpenClaw explainer → SOTW → recent skills

### Fixed
- **InstallBox copy buttons**: replaced `id="copy-btn"` + `getElementById` with `querySelectorAll('.copy-btn')` so every copy button works on pages with multiple InstallBox instances (homepage has 4, guide pages have 2)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Initial release: curated SKILL.md registry for OpenClaw and Claude Code
- Browse all skills at `/browse`
- Individual skill pages at `/[author]/[slug]`
- Live skill renderer at `/r/[github-path]`
- Bundle pages at `/bundles` and `/bundles/[slug]`
- OpenClaw-aligned visual identity: Bricolage Grotesque + Manrope + IBM Plex Mono, warm dark palette
